Practical Project Assignment for the Software Technologies Course @ SoftUni

Issue Tracker
Design and implement a simple issue tracking system (bug tracker).
Required functionalities:
* User registration (and optionally user profiles) / login / logout.
* View all issues (optionally with paging), without login.
* View issue details, without login.
* Create new issue (after login). Issues have title, description, author, state and submission date and time. States are: New, Open, Fixed and Closed.
Optional functionalities:
* Edit issue (after login). Can change only title, description and state.
* Add new comment for existing issue by visitors â€“ each visitor must fill out his name and comment text.
* Implement a sidebar holding a list of all issues states. Clicking at issue state shows all issues matching this state.
* Functionality for searching by title (as substring).
* Admin panel: add / edit / delete issues and comments, etc.
